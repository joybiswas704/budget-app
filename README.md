# budget-app
This is a budget app where you can add incomes and expenses in order to calculate the net remaining value to make budget.
I have used html5, css3 and vanila javaScript(ES6) in this project.
This project is originally created by Jonas Schmedtmann who is a Udemy instructor. I took his course and learned how to build it on my own.
